    <p> All the above services are stored on independent containers/pods on ECR(Elastic Container Registry) and deployed on Kubernetes Cluster(EKS) which is the objective of the project.
    <p> All the code will be stored on GitHub(SCM) repository and upon code commit/manual deployement, the purpose of DevOps is acheived.
